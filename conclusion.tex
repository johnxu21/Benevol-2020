\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
%We carried out an empirical analysis of forks variants, with the ultimate goal of investigating the social-technical specificities of the software families in the \js ecosystem whose repositories are hosted on \gh. 
We performed an exploratory investigation on the evolution variants focusing on their technical aspects. We mined repositories from the \js ecosystem, whose sources are hosted on \gh, having their package releases on \npm.
We identified a significant number of variants from the \js ecosystem. We observed that, compared to their mainline counterparts, variants have a significant number of package releases, package dependencies, dependent packages and dependent projects.

As future work, we plan to carry out an extensive investigation on the social-technical specificities of the software families in the \js ecosystem whose repositories are hosted on \gh.
