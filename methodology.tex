\section{Methods and Dataset}
\label{sec:method}
According to the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey\footnote{https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020} to which over 65,000 developers participated, \js is one the most commonly used programming language (67.7\% of all respondents make use of \js).




%\textbf{Dataset}.
 Our dataset of \gh repositories from the \js ecosystem and their corresponding \np packages, dependents and dependencies were extracted from the \texttt{libraries.io} release 1.6.0 of January 12, 2020. We use the following heuristics to extract the mainline--variant pairs of the software families in the \js ecosystem on \gh: the repository $A$ is a variant of the repository $B$ if (1) the package releases of $A$ and $B$ are distributed on \np and (2) $A$ is a fork of $B$ on \gh.
%\tom{On \gh?} 
Since we focus on the \js ecosystem on \gh, we extracted software families whose repositories are hosted on \gh and their packages distributed on \np.
%\tm{This sentence comes much too late and is not sufficiently detailed.} 
For each mainline and its corresponding variants we collected their releases, dependencies and dependents (projects and packages).
